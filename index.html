<p>You were dependable, entertaining, gracious, and capable of maintaining order in chaotic situations.
    We were able to be who we truly are in front of the camera because you made way for the delicate, spiritual, and natural moments! 
    I never fretted over a single picture.
    I never concerned about how I appeared.
    I never worried that a photo would have been overlooked.
    I never once worried. You all had my trust! 
    I was able to truly enjoy the time leading up to the wedding because of my faith. 
    What an invaluable gift.</p>

<p>"Viewing these photographs brought forth every feeling"
    I made an effort to convey my feelings appropriately, but nothing more profound than "WOW" would spring to mind.
     Looking at these photographs made me feel every emotion, and I really don't know how you manage to achieve it.
      Pictures aren't just things you see through your camera, but real, tangible events.</p>

            <p>Working with Scordy was a breeze, and it was obvious he takes great delight in his work, making sure everything is set up correctly for the finest shots.
                I loved meeting and chatting with Scordy while he worked, and the images he shot for me at my son's birthday turned out fantastic.
                I'm eager to use him for further projects. He performed beautifully. The photo quality was flawless, and he was kind and patient. 
                Highly recommend!!!</p>
